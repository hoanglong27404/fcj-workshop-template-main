## Event Objectives

- **Understand the differences between MFA technologies** (TOTP vs. FIDO2)
- **Identify common network attack vectors** (Ingress, Egress, and Inside attacks)
- **Learn how to implement multilayer security** using AWS services like WAF, Shield, Network Firewall, and Security Groups
- **Design "Good" traffic flows** using Transit Gateways and centralized egress points

## Key Highlights

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Evolution

#### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Relies on a shared secret and requires manually typing a 6-digit code
- It is free and offers flexible backups

#### FIDO2
- Utilizes public-key cryptography and requires a simple touch or biometric scan
- It supports variable authenticators and enforces strict backups

### Understanding Attack Vectors

#### Ingress Attacks
- Threats entering from the internet, such as DDoS attacks
- Application attacks (SQL injection, XSS)
- Bot activities

#### Inside Attacks
- Threats within the network, including lateral movement between services
- Malware spread

#### Egress Attacks
- Threats attempting to leave the network, such as DNS tunneling
- Data exfiltration

### Defense in Depth (Multilayer Security)

#### Edge Protection
- Use **CloudFront, WAF, and Shield** for DDoS prevention
- Application firewalls, bot control, and fraud detection

#### Network & Resource Control
- Implement **Security Groups & NACLs** for resource-level and network-level control against lateral movement

#### East-West Traffic
- Use **Network Firewalls (IPS/IDS)** to control traffic flow between VPCs

#### DNS Security
- Implement **Route 53 DNS Firewall** for domain filtering and blocking malicious site access

### Architecture & Traffic Flow

#### Traffic Routing
- Utilizing **Transit Gateway** with routing segments to manage complex connections between Production and Project VPCs

#### Centralized Egress
- Establishing a "Central Internet Egress" VPC to filter and monitor all outbound traffic via a Web Proxy or Firewall

#### Segmentation
- Separating environments (e.g., Prod, Project A, Project B) into distinct subnets (Web/App, DB) to contain potential breaches

## Key Takeaways

### Security Strategy

#### Layered Defense
- Security must be applied at multiple layers—Edge, Network, and Host—to effectively mitigate different types of attack vectors

#### Identity First
- Move towards stronger authentication methods like FIDO2 for better security and user experience compared to traditional TOTP

### Architectural Best Practices

#### Centralization
- Use Transit Gateways to centralize routing and simplify network management across multiple VPCs

#### Visibility
- Implementing specific controls like DNS Firewalls and Network Firewalls provides visibility into internal (East-West) and outbound traffic, not just incoming requests

## Applying to Work

### Review MFA Policy
- Evaluate the feasibility of moving from TOTP to FIDO2 hardware keys or biometrics for privileged accounts

### Audit Security Groups
- Review current Security Groups and NACLs to ensure they are strictly defined to prevent lateral movement

### Implement WAF
- Deploy AWS WAF on public-facing Application Load Balancers (ALB) or API Gateways to block common web exploits

### Network Segmentation
- Assess the current VPC architecture and consider implementing a Transit Gateway if managing multiple VPCs to ensure "good" traffic flow

## Event Experience

Attending the "AWS Network Security & Architecture" workshop provided a clear visual guide to securing cloud infrastructure. Key experiences included:

### Visualizing Security Layers
- The diagrams clearly illustrated how different AWS services (WAF, Shield, Network Firewall) map to specific attack vectors like DDoS or SQL injection
- It was valuable to see the distinction between guarding against "Ingress" attacks versus "Inside" lateral movements

### Understanding Modern Auth
- The direct comparison between TOTP and FIDO2 highlighted the trade-offs between convenience (touch/biometric) and traditional methods (typing codes)

### Architecture Deep Dive
- Seeing the "Good Traffic Flows" diagram helped clarify how to architect a production-grade network using Transit Gateways and centralized internet egress points

## Workshop Impact

This workshop provided essential knowledge for designing secure, scalable AWS network architectures. The emphasis on defense-in-depth strategies and practical implementation guidance made complex security concepts accessible and actionable.

The session reinforced the importance of thinking about security at the architectural level, not just as an add-on feature, and demonstrated how proper network design can significantly reduce attack surface and improve overall security posture.
