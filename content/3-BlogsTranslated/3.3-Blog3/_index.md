## Introduction

Dacadoo is a global technology company headquartered in Switzerland, specializing in solutions for:

- **Digital health interaction**
- **Health risk quantification**

Their products include a SaaS platform based on:

- **Behavioral science**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- **Gamification**

To help end users improve their health outcomes.

## The Modernization Journey

The company initiated an API modernization journey to:

- Quantify health and lifestyle data
- Provide risk assessment tools
- Calculate probability of mortality and morbidity based on scientific research data

To transform VM-based API services into a global health score and risk calculation solution with disaster recovery, dacadoo chose Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Results Achieved

The outcome:

* **78% cost reduction**  
* **Infrastructure maintenance time under 1 hour/year**  
* **Deploy multiple AWS infrastructures without expanding the SRE team**  
* **High automation levels and agile mindset**

## Context: Three Evolutionary Stages

The solution architecture evolved through three stages:

**Stage 1:** Incubation with Virtual Machines  
- Single virtual machine on-premises with disaster recovery (DR) in Switzerland

**Stage 2:** Global and Scalable  
- Multiple Kubernetes clusters globally

**Stage 3:** Operational Excellence  
- Fully serverless with geographic redundancy on AWS

## Stage 1: Incubation with Virtual Machines

### Initial Architecture

After years of scientific research and development, the service launched, running on:

- A single on-premises virtual machine
- Using hypervisor technology to provide disaster recovery (DR) capabilities

The application served:
- API requests
- NoSQL databases
- All running on the same server

### Challenges

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| High availability | No HA, manual recovery required |
| Software deployment | Manual via SSH |
| OS maintenance | Manual process |
| Automation level | Very low |
| Data backup | VM snapshots only |
| Monitoring | Manual, no automation |
| Testing | Developer workstation only |

### Key Limitations

- API available only in Switzerland
- Maintenance performed manually
- Software deployment handled manually
- No global scalability
- Personnel management issues

## Stage 2: Global and Scalable with Kubernetes

### Strategic Decision

Dacadoo made a strategic investment decision in:

- **Kubernetes** to manage containerized workloads
- **Global management** at scale

### Global Deployment

Due to geographically distributed customers and low-latency requirements:

**Three Kubernetes clusters deployed:**
- Each in a different continent
- NoSQL databases stored near workloads
- Reduced service latency and migration effort

### Operations Optimization

**NoSQL Databases:**
- Integrated as SaaS service
- Minimized operational maintenance

**Monitoring:**
- Centralized with Datadog

**Infrastructure Provisioning:**
- Exclusively with Terraform
- Includes: Kubernetes clusters, NoSQL databases, GitLab & Datadog integration

**CI/CD:**
- Using GitLab CI/CD
- Deploy to multiple environments and clusters
- Planetary-scale super system

### Comparison: VM vs Kubernetes

| Criteria | Virtual Machine | Kubernetes |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Scalability | Low | High |
| Availability | Best effort | 99.95% |
| Infrastructure cost | Low | High |
| Maintenance effort | High | Medium |

### Challenges

**High Costs:**
- Three regional Kubernetes clusters
- Three environments
- Total: 27 cluster nodes

**Additional Costs:**
- Managing NoSQL SaaS database instances for each cluster

**Complexity:**
- Multi-cluster multi-environment CI/CD processes
- Significant operational effort to maintain infrastructure
- Need for continuous updates to Kubernetes components

## Stage 3: Operational Excellence with Serverless

### Why Move to Serverless?

The Kubernetes-based architecture met requirements, but:

- Some API backlog features needed better alignment
- Architecture needed alignment with latest technology
- Need to optimize best practices

This was the right time to:
- Take a holistic view of infrastructure and software architecture
- Refactor the solution with AWS's latest technology

### Solution Requirements

Requirements for the refactoring:

* **Maintain API functionality**

* **Restrict data processing to selected regions** (comply with local data protection laws)

* **Avoid weekly patching cycles** - use only managed serverless services

* **Reduce costs** - choose services with pay-as-you-go pricing

* **Delegate authentication to dedicated service**

* **Use established web framework with broad ecosystem**

### Application Refactoring

**API service comprises:**
- Developer Portal (Developer Portal)
- Health score and risk calculation API

**Database only needs:**
- API keys
- Algorithm parameters
- Quotas
- Usage statistics

### Distributed Database

**Health Data:**
- Processed by region by compute layer
- NOT stored (only temporary processing)
- Opens opportunity for distributed database

**Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables:**
- Perfect choice for this solution
- Writes: Distributed to all connected regions
- Reads: Performed locally
- Low latency - meets Dacadoo's SLAs

### Architecture Components

**Developer Portal:**
- Web user interface
- API documentation
- API key management
- AWS Lambda - auto-scaling, pay-per-request

**Health and Risk API:**
- Algorithms implemented in C (short simulations)
- Requires compute-intensive calculations
- REST API wrapped in Python FastAPI
- AWS Lambda - excellent choice

## Serverless Architecture in Detail

### Request Flow

**HTTP Requests:**
- Routed via Amazon API Gateway
- Protected by AWS WAF (against malicious requests)
- Forwarded to AWS Lambda functions

**Static Resources:**
- Served from Amazon S3
- Via API Gateway
- CloudFront not required (reduces complexity)

### Global DNS Routing

**Amazon Route 53 - Latency-based Routing:**
- Redirects DNS queries to the lowest-latency endpoint
- Provides regional HA for API users
- Doesn't require specific data processing location
- Users can call region-specific endpoints (if regulatory compliance needed)

### Authentication and Authorization

**API Authorization:**
- Based on HTTP headers
- Implemented in the application
- Data stored in Amazon DynamoDB

## Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi

### Tool Selection

The SRE team proficient in Python, selected Pulumi:

**Advantages:**

* **Programming language control flow** - language programming  
* **Powerful configuration capabilities**  
* **Multi-cloud support**

### CI/CD Pipeline

**GitLab CI:**
- Compile algorithm library
- Test FastAPI applications
- Package everything

**Deployment:**
- Just an AWS Lambda update
- Simple and reliable workflow

### Skill Enhancement

**Transformation:**
- From configuration-based approach
- To infrastructure code base design
- Using Python object-oriented programming

**Results:**
- SRE develop software engineering skills
- Investment in team modernization
- GitOps culture focused on productivity
