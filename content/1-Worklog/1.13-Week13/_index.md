## Objectives for Week 13
- Complete and fix the AI Search (semantic search) feature in the FindNest project
- Perform end-to-end testing from frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock/DynamoDB
- Improve prompts, handle errors, and optimize response performance

## Tasks planned this week

| Day | Task | Start Date | End Date | Notes |
|-----|------|------------|----------|-------|
| Mon | Experiment with different prompts to improve semantic search | 01/12/2025 | 01/12/2025 | Compare few-shot vs minimal prompts |
| Tue | Debug Lambda search handler and validate Bedrock requests | 02/12/2025 | 02/12/2025 | Fix input format for Bedrock |
| Wed | Add input validation and fallback logic | 03/12/2025 | 03/12/2025 | Prevent returning noisy results |
| Thu | Optimize DynamoDB queries and add temporary caching | 04/12/2025 | 04/12/2025 | Use TTL and in-memory cache in Lambda |
| Fri | Integration testing with FE, collect feedback, fix UI edgecases | 05/12/2025 | 05/12/2025 | Align request/response schema |

## Results for Week 13
- AI Search now returns results that better match user queries; semantic relevance improved noticeably
- Latency reduced by ~30% for common queries thanks to temporary Lambda caching and DynamoDB query optimization
- Input parsing errors were handled; the frontend now receives clear error codes for malformed requests
- End-to-end integration (FE → API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock/DynamoDB) is stable in dev/staging environments
