Now, let's turn this design into reality.

## Step 1: Synthesize
Run the synthesize command to generate the CloudFormation template:

```bash
cdk synth
```

This command generates the CloudFormation template in the cdk.out directory. If no red errors appear, you may proceed.

The synthesize process converts your CDK code (TypeScript) into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML).

## Step 2: Deploy
Deploy the stack to AWS:

```bash
cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

The --require-approval never flag bypasses the confirmation prompt for IAM changes.

The deployment process will take approximately 5-10 minutes to provision all resources.

During deployment, you'll see:

- CloudFormation stack creation progress
- Individual resources being created (DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, API Gateway, etc.)
- Status updates for each resource

Wait for the deployment to complete successfully before proceeding to the next step.
