The beauty of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK is that you can dismantle the entire system with a single command.

CDK knows exactly what it created and will delete resources in the correct dependency order.

## Navigate to CDK Directory
Make sure you are in the cdk directory:

```bash
cd cdk
```

## Run Destroy Command
Execute the following command:

```bash
cdk destroy
```

## Confirmation Prompt
The CLI will ask for confirmation:

```
Are you sure you want to delete: BackendStack (y/n)?
```

Type `y` and press Enter.

## Deletion Process
The deletion process generally takes 3-5 minutes.

You will see output similar to:

```
BackendStack: destroying...

 *  BackendStack: destroyed

Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/BackendStack/...
```

## What Gets Deleted
CDK will automatically delete all resources in the correct order:

- **API Gateway** - REST API and deployment
- **Lambda Function** - Including associated IAM roles
- **DynamoDB Tables** - All 7 tables
- **Cognito User Pool** - Users and groups
- **Cognito Identity Pool** - Identity mappings
- **S3 Bucket** - Including all objects (due to autoDeleteObjects: true)
- **Location Service** - Maps, Place Index, Route Calculator
- **CloudWatch Log Groups** - Lambda execution logs
- **IAM Roles and Policies** - All service permissions
- **CloudFormation Stack** - The stack itself

The `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` configuration in our CDK code ensures that data-containing resources (like DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets) are also deleted.

## Monitor Deletion Progress
You can monitor the deletion progress in:

- **Terminal**: Watch the CLI output
- **AWS Console**: Go to CloudFormation → Stacks → BackendStack → Events tab

## Troubleshooting Deletion Issues
If the deletion fails:

**Issue: S3 Bucket Not Empty**

```bash
# Manually empty the bucket
aws s3 rm s3://findnest-images-YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID --recursive

# Then retry destroy
cdk destroy
```

**Issue: DynamoDB Table Has Deletion Protection**

If you modified the tables manually in console and enabled deletion protection, you need to disable it first:

1. Go to DynamoDB Console
2. Select the table
3. Go to Additional settings tab
4. Turn off Deletion protection
5. Retry `cdk destroy`

**Issue: Lambda Execution Role In Use**

Wait a few minutes for Lambda executions to complete, then retry.

Once you run `cdk destroy` and confirm, the process cannot be undone. All data will be permanently deleted.
